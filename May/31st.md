- [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
  - Kafka® is used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming apps. 
    It is horizontally scalable, fault-tolerant, wicked fast, and runs in production 
    in thousands of companies.
- [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
  - Apache Spark achieves high performance for both batch and streaming data, using a state-of-the-art DAG scheduler, a query optimizer, and a physical execution engine.
  - Write applications quickly in Java, Scala, Python, R, and SQL.
- [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/)
  - The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for 
    the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of 
    computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale 
    up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering 
    local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to 
    deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect 
    and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a 
    highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of 
    which may be prone to failures.
 - [Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/)
  - The Apache Hive ™ data warehouse software facilitates reading, 
    writing, and managing large datasets residing in distributed storage 
    using SQL. Structure can be projected onto data already in storage. A 
    command line tool and JDBC driver are provided to connect users to Hive.
- [Apache Flink](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/apache-flink-stream-processing-getting-started?aid=701j0000001heIoAAI&promo=&utm_source=non_branded&utm_medium=digital_paid_search_google&utm_campaign=US_Dynamic&utm_content=&gclid=CjwKCAjwq832BRA5EiwACvCWsdiObuDwp2oRKdd_KRGeTEpzZXPG9Br40lpTBaNPd-i0KWTpjgSTeRoC6nAQAvD_BwE)
  - Flink is a stateful, tolerant, and large scale system with excellent 
  latency and throughput characteristics. It works with bounded and unbounded 
  datasets using the same underlying stream-first architecture, focusing 
  on streaming or unbounded data.

# Debian - How to get access to its terminal while in Arch Linux
 
- https://distrotest.net/
- debootstrap, debian chroot
- You could use docker or lxd. Those are both capable of automatically installing a basic Debian system in a few seconds in an isolated environment.
- Or you may try a Vagrant box. It is preinstalled and configured lightweight virtual machine. You get fully configured Debian without GUI.
https://www.vagrantbox.es/
- Docker is your best bet if you want a simple cli system It will run containerized, using the kernel of your host system. If you want a quick system you can bring up and destroy on-demand or have a second apt-based distro running persistently, this will be by far the fastest and easiest way to stand up a second Linux system under Arch.
- Even simpler, you can always use https://packages.debian.org/ and see which version of debian specific packages are in. I use it all the time a as Debian user.
- Amazon EC2 (free tier)
- its best the use the normal install...there're BSDs and Linuxes that provide minimal install...Debian is installed on my MacPro thru virtualbox and only connect using the terminal for programing...the total storage on my Mac is 250G
- if you install debian from the netinstall you'll come to a software selection part. uncheck everything except ssh server and standard system utilities. finish the install and all you will have is a terminal and debian linux system tools. it should have everything you need to start.
